diRf_client
===========

diRf client v3.x (ioquake3 svn 2251)

diRf client is a customized build of ioquake3 for Urban Terror 4.x
It provides enhanced sound and environment 'hacks' that may or may not be
acceptable for league use.

Additions: SACC (Slackins Advanced Competitive Client) and dmaHD by
p5ych0runn3r.

Added cvars:
s_envSoundEnable [0|1] -- to enable or disable "environmental" sounds
com_nosplash [0|1] -- enable/disable Frozen Sand splash screen on client start (set this in your autoexec.cfg)

What you can expect to hear / not hear:
dmaHD greatly enhances the precision of sound and adds doppler effect to
moving entities and projectiles. Overall, it sounds a lot better than the
stock sound.
You will NOT hear your own player model breathe, swim, or use med-kit!!! But
you can still hear friends and foes do all such things.
Note on swimming: I have decided to leave "stepping in a puddle" sounds
enabled.
The bottom line is: If you are using this build, you must be aware of the
sounds you make (pay attention to your stamina) because even though you cannot
hear them yourself, others will.

Note on wall hacking:
This client build does not affect client QVM in any way - nor does it
introduce or amplify any sort of sounds that don't already exist in the game.
dmaHD enhances sound precision and quality and by disabling environmental
noise, you will not hear things like music, city noises in turnpike, loud
helicopter and PA announcements in subway, etc. This allows you to hear the
same sounds that have always been there, only more clearly. And thus, should
not be considered a cheat. Use caution! You could be accused of wall hacking.
Also, do not assume others are wall hacking because "I wasnt making noise."
I'll reiterate: Just because YOU can't hear yourself with this build, does NOT
mean others can't hear you.
