diRf_client
===========

diRf client v3.x (ioquake3 svn 2252)

* diRf client is a customized version of ioquake3 for Urban Terror 4.x
  by Frozen Sand. It includes enhanced sound hacks that may or may not be
  accepted for league use.

* More specifically, diRf client is bleeding edge ioquake3 with SACC and dmaHD.
  Also, there are additional tweaks that allow you to remove ambient background
  noise and music in all base maps and most third-party maps.

* Added cvars:
 ** s_envSoundEnable [0|1] -- to enable or disable ambient background sounds.
 ** com_nosplash [0|1]     -- enable/disable Frozen Sand splash screen on
                            client start (set this in your autoexec.cfg)

* For those familiar with SACC, the defaults in diRf client have been increased.
  The default values are much higher but you may still tweak them to lesser
  values. YMMV depending on the throughput of your network.

* What you can expect to hear / not hear:
  dmaHD greatly enhances sound quality and precision, and also adds
  doppler effect to moving entities and projectiles. It is similar to ikalizer,
  but is cross-platform. You will NOT hear your own player model breathe,
  swim, or use med-kit!!! But you can hear friends/foes do all such things.

* Be sure to direct the haters and accusers to our github so they can see
  that you're not wallhacking.

* respect!
